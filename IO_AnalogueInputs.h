/**********************************************************************************************
 * ADS111x class for I2C-connected analogue input modules ADS1113, ADS1114 and ADS1115.
 * 
 * ADS1113 and ADS1114 are restricted to 1 input.  ADS1115 has a multiplexer which allows 
 * any of four input pins to be read by its ADC.
 * 
 * The driver polls the device in accordance with the constant 'scanInterval' below.  On first loop
 * entry, the multiplexer is set to pin A0 and the ADC is triggered.  On second and subsequent
 * entries, the analogue value is read from the conversion register and then the multiplexer and
 * ADC are set up to read the next pin.
 * 
 * The ADS111x is set up as follows:
 *    Single-shot scan
 *    Data rate 128 samples/sec (7.8ms/sample, but scanned every 10ms)
 *    Comparator off
 *    Gain FSR=6.144V
 * The gain means that the maximum input voltage of 5V (when Vss=5V) gives a reading 
 * of 32767*(5.0/6.144) = 26666.
 * 
 * A device is configured by the following:
 *   ADS111x::create(firstVpin, nPins, i2cAddress);
 * for example
 *   ADS111x::create(300, 1, 0x48);  // single-input ADS1113
 *   ADS111x::create(300, 4, 0x48);  // four-input ADS1115
 * 
 * Note: The device is simple and does not need initial configuration, so it should recover from
 * temporary loss of communications or power.
